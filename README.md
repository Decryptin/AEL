# Numeral-System Library.
### Ok, but like honestly why do I even exist? Do I even deserve this, like what is the point?
* Well, for one you exist to be a numeral to numeral system translator. You can convert from notational systems to even cultural numeral systems. 

_NSL: Ok, that's cool and all but that's ~~**kinda lame bro**~~._

* Ok, what if I told you that not only can you translate numeral-systems but you can also evaluate arithmetic expressions with multiple numeral systems?

_NSL: Ok bro, you got me like mad confused, what the heck.__ 

* Ok here's an example, '10110+F6A/763.65'

- As you can see, there's one binary number(10110), one hexadecimal number(F6A), and one decimal number(763.65). You would be able to evaluate this expression and return the result in the desired numeral system! How cool is that!?
- Not only can it evaluate expressions like this, but it supports preset equations and expressions such as The Quadratic Equation, The pythagorean theorem and many more!

__Let me tell you about the many features this library is planned to have__.
