# Numeral-System Library.
### Ok, but like honestly why do I even exist? Do I even deserve this, like what is the point?
* Well, for one you exist to be a numeral to numeral system translator. You can convert from notational systems to even cultural numeral systems. 

_NSL: Ok, that's cool and all but that's ~~**kinda lame bro**~~._

* Ok, what if I told you that not only can you translate numeral-systems but you can also evaluate arithmetic expressions with multiple numeral systems?

_NSL: Ok bro, you got me like mad confused, what the heck.__ 

* Ok here's an example, '10110+F6A/763.65'

As you can see, there's one binary number(10110), one hexadecimal number(F6A), and one decimal number(763.65).
