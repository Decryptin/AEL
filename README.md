# Numeral-System Library.
## Ok, but like honestly why do i even exist? Do I even deserve this, like what is the point?
The first purpose for this library existing is to serve as a library that's capable of conversions numeral-to-numeral system wise.
The second purpose for this library existing is building on purpose #1, and that's to have the capability to evaluate arithmetic expressions that include 
multiple numeral-systems. 
For example, an multi-numeral-system expression could be as such: 'FF6h+11010b*565o-454.76'

The library will support evaluating a collection of algebraic formula's/expressions regardless of numeral-systems included.
The library will support a collection of notational and cultural numeral systems, including older ones such as Roman Numerals.
